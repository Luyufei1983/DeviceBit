The DeviceBit system distinguishes your gateways, devices and applications with others by different user keys.

## 6.2 Sub-account Settings

Once you have registered your account on DeviceBit platform, you can define several sub-accounts under your main account, giving the sub-accounts different authorizations. For example, one of your sub-account has the right to query without the right to add a sensor or a controller and modify personal information. Thus, your account is operated as an administrator, and could assign a number of sub-accounts. You can let somebody else maintain your equipment without having to worry that he accidentally delete or misuse your equipment. Go to _**My Account -&gt;Sub-account -&gt;Add A Sub-user**_ ![](https://leweidoc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/lewei50/img/devicebitmanual-xj-20180930-36.jpg) Pic.2 Add A Sub-user Click on _**Add A Sub-user**_ to fill in the information, including the username, password, name and description, and then tick the items of operation rights for the sub-user. Thus, the sub-user could login to the system with the format _**Main-account: Sub-account**_ and change the password.
